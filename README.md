# WhatsApp
Source_Code of WhatsApp
While i was reverse engineered the WhatsApp.apk
Firstly i used the tool called as apktool to decode the .apk file of WhatsApp
then after i got decoded WhatsApp floder containing file of WhatsApp .
After that i get two main files .xml and classes.dex file. 
From where i started converting the classes.dex file to classes-dex2jar.jar
which contains the java code for WhatsApp and i used Java-Decompiler(jd-gui) to see the code of
Whatsapp present inside the classes-dex2jar.jar file.
